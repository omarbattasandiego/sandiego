EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:





SUMMARY & CONCLUSION:

	The lab was a success in analyzing and learning about the properties of concrete. It was extremely beneficial because we were able to see how our batch changes over time in terms of strength. From there, we were able to evaluate and distinguish between the different properties, based on the graph given. We can conclude that concrete increased over time. The fact that we mixed between conceptual and practical shows the broad spectrum of knowledge and experience attained during this lab.

SOURCES OF ERROR: 
•	Human inaccuracies in measurements and procedures when preparing and conducting the labs.
•	Devices could have been read wrong by the naked eye, although would only be a slight error.
•	 Measuring device was an older piece of equipment so there could be inaccuracies there as well.
